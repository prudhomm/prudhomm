### Hi there, I am Christophe ðŸ‘‹

I am a Professor in Applied Mathematics at the University of Strasbourg in France. 
Iâ€™m passionate about mathematics and their endless applications in industry, sciences in particular health and environmental sciences. 

### A little bit of myself

I got my Ph.D. at University Pierre and Marie Curie in Paris in 2000.
Then I spent 3 years at MIT in Mech. Eng. Dept. working on reduced basis output bounds methods.
Between 2003 and 2006, I was at EPFL, Switzerland, where I worked on various projects in Health as well as Solar Impulse airplane by Bertrand Picard. Since 2006, I am a full Professor, first in Grenoble until 2012 and since Sept. 2012 in Strasbourg.

In 2013, I created and since then lead [Cemosis](https://www.cemosis.fr), the Center for Modeling and Simulation in Strasbourg, which the technological platform in Mathematics of the University to develop collaboration with Enterprises and Other Disciplines.

We have various [collaborations](https://www.cemosis.fr/projects) in Physics, Health and more recently we started in Environmental Sciences. 
We aim at pushing state of the art and beyond mathematics in applications.

My expertise is in Modeling Simulation and Optimization as well as Scientific and High Performance Computing. 
In particular, I am interested in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) efficiently using methods such that Finite Element (cG, hdG), domain decomposition methods, fictitious domain methods.Reduced order methods are a major interest as well in the context of Optimization, Uncertainty Quantification and Real-Time Control.
Recently I started mixing PDEs methods with machine/deep learning methods.

### ðŸ”­ Open Science and Open Software

All this time, and it started way before my academic career in 1990 with Linux, I worked with and contributed to Open Source Software. 
In 2006, I started [Feel++](https://github.com/feelpp/feelpp).
Feel++ has matured and is now behind most of our [collaborations](https://www.cemosis.fr/projects) at Cemosis and it is used also in Master and Ph.D. level courses.
Feel++ is a framework written in C++ which aims at solving efficiently PDEs with a wide range of numerical methods.
To this end, I have developed a DSEL for variational formulation embedded in C++ that allows to write formulation close to the mathematical one and hide many details to the mathematician and empower him to develop and test (new) methods. 
Recently a set of mono and multi-physics toolboxes have been developed to facilitate the development of applications.

### ðŸ‘¯ Always looking for collaborations !

If you are interested in our Open Source project [feelpp](https://github.com/feelpp/feelpp) or one of the projects we are working on at [Cemosis](https://www.cemosis.fr/projects) or if you have a collaboration to propose, don't hesitate to contact by [email](https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=christophe.prudhomme@cemosis.fr), via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/prudhomm) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopheprudhomme/).
